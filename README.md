This is a sample application used for practising some coding concepts in Android. Features of this app include chat using socket.io with real-time typing updates similar to an app called Beam Messenger (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beamlab.beam&hl=en), stripe api implementation, GPS updates and other basic/standard Android stuff.

There's also a "build.gradle.sample" file located in the "app/build.gradle.sample" path. I removed the original "build.gradle" file to prevent checking in sensitive information for a public repository.
